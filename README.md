QSsh provides SSH and SFTP support for Qt applications without depending on openssh or similar

QSsh provides SSH and SFTP support for Qt applications without depending on openssh or similar. The aim of this project is to provide an easy way to use these protocols in any Qt application.

This project is based on Qt Creator's previous SSH plugin. All credits to Qt Creator's team!

Unfortunately Qt Creator has decided to start using openssh instead (with some hacks invoking it etc.), so this is now the most up to date maintained version.
